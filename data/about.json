  "text": "<p>I'm not someone who always knew their passion from a young age and chased it relentlessly. Instead, I found my calling in <em>web development</em> later on, after exploring various paths.</p><p>But the moment I started playing around with HTML, everything clicked and I knew instantly that I had found my <em>lifelong pursuit</em>. Since then, I've been dedicated to improving my skills and expanding my knowledge daily, striving to grow both as a <em>developer</em> and as a <em>person</em>.</p>Being <em>self-taught</em>, I would like to express my gratitude to all these people who make it happen, either with their open-source contributions or by sharing their experience in the form of a blog post, a course or in real life. I hope that someday I will give back to the community as well!<p></p><p>I am currently located in Greece, studying web development and learning Dutch while planning my relocation and looking for new opportunities in <em>the Netherlands</em>.</p>"
