  "text": "<p>I'm not someone who always knew their passion from a young age. Instead, I found my calling in <em>web development</em> later on, after exploring various paths.</p><p>But the moment I started playing around with HTML I knew instantly that I had found my <em>lifelong pursuit</em>. Since then, I've been dedicated to improving my skills and expanding my knowledge daily, <em>striving to grow</em> both as a developer and as a person.</p><p>Being <em>self-taught</em>, I am extremely grateful for all those who make it happen, either with their open-source contributions or by sharing their experience in the form of a blog post, a course or in real life. I hope that someday I will give back to the community as well!</p>"
