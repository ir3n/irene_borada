  "text": "<p>I worked for nearly five years at <em>Rocket Path</em>, a digital agency in Greece.<br/>I initially learned Drupal and PHP on the job. I contributed to various E-commerce projects and independently developed multiple presentation websites and HTML landing pages, along with SCSS and JavaScript. In my last 2.5 years, I joined the React team, building decoupled E-commerce websites using Next.js and Chakra UI.</p><p>In summer 2024, I moved to the Netherlands and am excited to be part of the engineering team at <em>Coolset</em>, a sustainability-focused company that provides a platform for carbon management and compliance reporting. The frontend is primarily built with React and TypeScript.</p><p>With a packed schedule over the years, <em>personal projects</em> were limited, but between these roles, I worked on a few, some of which are showcased below.</p>",
