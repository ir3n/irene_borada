I quickly adapted to the new environment, understanding the concepts with minimal guidance. Additionally, I proposed improvements for our workflow, for cleaner & reusable code and and contributed to improving site performance.</p><p>Since my schedule these years was packed, there was little room for <em>personal projects</em>.
